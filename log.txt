It is a real interplay between the materials and a clear proof of true craftsmanship. &#8221;I have searched the expression where there is some difference between each lamp. Since the brass cage only partially controls the glass, every lamp turns out into unique pieces. It all depends on how much air that is blown into the glass during production. A certain moment is captured and each and every one is unique” says Gustaf Nordenskiöld.</p>\n' +

Two of the new models are having a suspension that can be compared to the stick the Hobos used carrying their bundles with. The lamp is carried by a curved brass hook. Here the weight gets visible. “It is as if the weight makes the form of the lamp”, Gustaf Nordenskiöld says.</p>\n',

        '<p>This single-spot Star lamp fits to a wall or ceiling to provide a versatile solution for all sorts of interior decoration needs. Another big advantage is that installation to a 230 V circuit means there is no need for a transformer.

        'Hobo is a lamp made of opaque blown glass (blown at the glass studio Mickejohans in Örsjö) formed into a basket construction of brass. It is a real interplay between the materials and a clear proof of true craftsmanship. &#8221;I have searched the expression where there is some difference between each lamp. Since the brass cage only partially controls the glass, every lamp turns out into unique pieces. It all depends on how much air that is blown into the glass during production. A certain moment is captured and each and every one is unique” says Gustaf Nordenskiöld.</p>\n' +
        '<p>Hobo is characterized by its weight and its details, two parameters that Hobo rather highlights than hides. Details become clear by visible bolts and heavy ropes. The wall model is having a suspension that can be compared to the stick the Hobos used carrying their bundles with. The lamp is carried by a curved brass hook. Here the weight gets visible. “It is as if the weight makes the form of the lamp,” Gustaf Nordenskiöld says.</p>\n',

With its domed opalescent shade and dimmer function Vinge is equally decorative lit or unlit, a focus of attention that gives users full freedom to adjust lighting to their needs.

        '<p>Star is available as versatile track lighting that can be installed either vertically or horizontally to adapt to requirements and the setting in which it is used. Simple installation to a 230 V circuit means there is no need for a transformer. Tracks come in standard lengths of 1 metre and 2 metres and connect with an earthed/grounded plug. It is also possible to customise the size and shape of Star track lighting to meet wishes for L-shaped, rectangular or square configurations, long or short lengths and other adaptations. The track can also be suspended on wires. If you would like to discuss your project specifications with us or request an offer, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>\n',

        '<p>The first edition of Kvist, launched in 1999, symbolised in many ways the most distinctive qualities of Jonas Bohlin’s design: “function, innovation and personality”.<!--more--><br />\n' +
        'Kvist is the Swedish word for “branch”. The form, which is restrained yet highly functional with dimmable light sources that can be directed, is inspired by the branches of a tree.<br />\n' +
        '”When my son was born, I planted an apple tree. The apple tree is still there, growing and bearing fruit. Kvist, too, is a ”tree” that ages gracefully,” says Jonas Bohlin.<br />\n' +
        'Here at Örsjö Belysning we are committed to working with high quality materials. That is why we have chosen to use durable brass and copper. These are materials that endure – materials that age with dignity, gently shifting in shade over time, slowly developing a unique patina to become more beautiful with each passing year.</p>\n' +
        '<p>Kvist with a choice of 4, 6 or 16 “branches” has become a popular evergreen, equally at home in domestic settings and in public spaces. The cord is a generous 5 metres long.

        '<p>One of the design features of Butler is the leather-covered arm on the adjustable spotlight – a smart solution that enables you to direct the light to exactly where you need it when reading. The craftsmanship that goes into the manufacturing process here at Örsjö Lighting is clearly visible, for example, in the soldering work on the raw brass.<br />\n' +
        'The lamp serves a double purpose thanks to its two light sources, one fixed, one adjustable. Joel himself says, “Electronics should work like silent servants, always on hand when we need them. This lamp is like an attentive valet, standing patiently behind your chair to provide you with the right reading light whenever you require. It’s the perfect butler.”</p>\n' +
        '<p>Butler wall lamp is equally much at home in both public spaces and domestic settings. The perfect reading lamp, easily directed so as not to disturb anyone else in the room.</p>\n',

        '<p>Hobo is a lamp made of opaque blown glass (blown at the glass studio Mickejohans in Örsjö) formed into a basket construction of brass. It is a real interplay between the materials and a clear proof of true craftsmanship. &#8221;I have searched the expression where there is some difference between each lamp. Since the brass cage only partially controls the glass, every lamp turns out into unique pieces. It all depends on how much air that is blown into the glass during production. A certain moment is captured and each and every one is unique” says Gustaf Nordenskiöld.</p>\n' +
        '<p>Hobo is characterized by its weight and its details, two parameters that Hobo rather highlights than hides. Details become clear by visible bolts and heavy ropes. Two of the new models are having a suspension that can be compared to the stick the Hobos used carrying their bundles with. The lamp is carried by a curved brass hook. Here the weight gets visible. “It is as if the weight makes the form of the lamp”, Gustaf Nordenskiöld says.</p>\n',

Ideally suited to a wide variety of styles and surroundings, the lamp combines flair with function.

        'Hobo is a lamp made of opaque blown glass (blown at the glass studio Mickejohans in Örsjö) formed into a basket construction of brass. It is a real interplay between the materials and a clear proof of true craftsmanship. &#8221;I have searched the expression where there is some difference between each lamp. Since the brass cage only partially controls the glass, every lamp turns out into unique pieces. It all depends on how much air that is blown into the glass during production. A certain moment is captured and each and every one is unique” says Gustaf Nordenskiöld.</p>\n' +

The wall model is having a suspension that can be compared to the stick the Hobos used carrying their bundles with. The lamp is carried by a curved brass hook. Here the weight gets visible. “It is as if the weight makes the form of the lamp,” Gustaf Nordenskiöld says.</p>\n',

        'The distinctive wing to which the lamp owes its name, is a dimmer in lacquered metal or solid brass that rotates around its own axis, almost irresistible in inviting and enticing interaction. The movement of your hand and the sweep of the wing have an immediate effect on the luminosity of the lamp, transforming lighting into a tactile sensation. With its domed opalescent shade and dimmer function Vinge is equally decorative lit or unlit, a focus of attention that gives users full freedom to adjust lighting to their needs. With Vinge, lighting is always a matter of choice, never a matter of chance.</p>\n',

        '<p>Star is available as versatile track lighting that can be installed either vertically or horizontally to adapt to requirements and the setting in which it is used. Simple installation to a 230 V circuit means there is no need for a transformer. Tracks come in standard lengths of 1 metre and 2 metres and connect with an earthed/grounded plug. It is also possible to customise the size and shape of Star track lighting to meet wishes for L-shaped, rectangular or square configurations, long or short lengths and other adaptations. The track can also be suspended on wires. If you would like to discuss your project specifications with us or request an offer, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>\n',

These lamps are equally at home in a variety of different settings and possess all the characteristics to quickly become a personal favourite. The light source has now been modernised with an LED lamp replacing the halogen bulb of the earlier versions.</p>\n',

        '<p>The first edition of Kvist, launched in 1999, symbolised in many ways the most distinctive qualities of Jonas Bohlin’s design: “function, innovation and personality”.<!--more--><br />\n' +
        'Kvist is the Swedish word for “branch”. The form, which is restrained yet highly functional with dimmable light sources that can be directed, is inspired by the branches of a tree.<br />\n' +
        '”When my son was born, I planted an apple tree. The apple tree is still there, growing and bearing fruit. Kvist, too, is a ”tree” that ages gracefully,” says Jonas Bohlin.<br />\n' +
        'Here at Örsjö Belysning we are committed to working with high quality materials. That is why we have chosen to use durable brass and copper. These are materials that endure – materials that age with dignity, gently shifting in shade over time, slowly developing a unique patina to become more beautiful with each passing year.</p>\n' +
        '<p>Kvist with a choice of 4, 6 or 16 “branches” has become a popular evergreen, equally at home in domestic settings and in public spaces. The cord is a generous 5 metres long.
